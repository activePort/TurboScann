<p>TurboScann is a simple bash script that streamlines the port scanning process with nmap.</p>

<p>The first thing it does is to see which ports are open on the target with the -sS flag, a minimum rate of packets per second to be sent during the scan of 5000 and -Pn to perform the scan without sending a host discovery ping.</p>

```shell
  nmap_result=$(nmap -p- --open -sS --min-rate 5000 $IP -Pn)
```

After getting the list of ports that are open, it performs another scan to determine the service and version running on those ports.

```shell
  nmap_second_result=$(nmap -sC -sV -p$open_ports $IP -Pn)
```

<p>After the last scan is done, the browser opens with the final result in html.</p>
